Welcome to this year's annual blog post!

I've been signing `git` commits for my [dotfiles] repository since its
inception in October of last year, so I was excited to see that GitHub recently
added [GPG signature verification]. All you have to do is upload your
[public key] to GitHub and you'll be verifying commits like a champ. Or so I
thoughtâ€¦

GitHub thinks I'm unverified. I think that's some baloney. I _know_ the public
key I uploaded matches the private key I used to sign those commits. Oh, it
looks like what they're really concerned about though is that the email on my
PGP key doesn't match the email I used with `git`.

Now, before we go any further I should point out I wouldn't be having any
problems at all if my `user.email` matched my GPG key to begin with, but
hindsight is 20/20. As it stands, I have a problem and I need to fix it. I need
to modify the authorship of these commits to match the email in my GPG key.

## How to Fix It

I recently learned that `git` has a tool called `git filter-branch` that can be
used to make significant and otherwise tedious modifications to `git` history.
A quick trip to Stack Overflow reveals I can use this tool to
[change the authorship] of all the commits in my repository.

Reckless reading leads me to this potential solution.
```bash
git filter-branch -f --env-filter "GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='reilly@tuckersiemens.com'" HEAD
```

Oh. No. Something is _clearly_ wrong. Looks more like `git filter-wat`.

## How to Actually Fix It

To be honest, I half expected something like this to happen. With the previous
command I was never asked to resign these commits. The text of my commit
message has been clobbered with the PGP signature. How do I fix that?

Some advocate not signing individual commits and instead just
[using a signed tag], but I don't subscribe to that idea. I really want each
individual commit to be signed.

[Additional Stack Overflowing] (yes, that's a verb) indicates I can use
`git filter-branch`'s `--msg-filter` and `--commit-filter` options to strip the
PGP signature from the commit message and then resign each commit. This ends up
looking like

```bash
git filter-branch -f --env-filter "GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='reilly@tuckersiemens.com'" --msg-filter 'sed "/iQIcBA.*/,/.*END PGP SIGNATURE.*/d"' --commit-filter 'git commit-tree -S "$@"' HEAD
```

The `--msg-filter` uses a `sed` expression to match and delete the PGP
signature up to the `END PGP SIGNATURE` bit. This leaves the rest of the commit
object (basically just the message) intact. The modified object is then passed
to the `git commit-tree` in the `--commit-filter` which then requires me to
resign the commit.

Annoyingly, when I actually ran this command I had to sign **each and every**
commit even though I had a `gpg-agent` running. If anyone can tell me how to
avoid that in the future I'd love to know. Luckily it was only 15 commits, but
I would find entering a passphrase any more than that rather aggravating.

At this point the unwieldly `git filter-branch` incantation has been uttered.
Let's just double-check the modified commits with a quick `git log`.

```
commit 87051d659d16dbe037c9d61dbaaeea38e152a9ff
Author: Reilly Tucker Siemens <reilly@tuckersiemens.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 5 15:10:18 2016 -0800

    Add cookiecutter configuration.

commit c56aff44af574bca227587e0f12f5ce841afd2d0
Author: Reilly Tucker Siemens <reilly@tuckersiemens.com>
Date:   Sat Feb 20 14:20:34 2016 -0800

    Add Go to PATH. Make Virtualenv Wrapper config more flexible.
```

**Looks good to me!** Notice that the email isn't the only thing that's
changed. The commit hash is also completely different. These aren't modified
commits, they're new git objects with the author, date, and commit message
preserved. In order to get my changes up to GitHub I'll have to
`git push --force origin master` to blow away my previous history. Most of the
time this is probably a bad idea, but this repository exists just for me, so I
feel comfortable taking the sledgehammer approach.

## Back to Square One

<figure>
<img src='signature-doesnt-match-committer.png' alt="Signature Doesn't Match Committer">
<figcaption>
These commits are <em>still</em> unverified on GitHub. <a href='signature-doesnt-match-committer.png'>View full size.</a>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Well, that didn't change anything. What gives? What am I missing? How does
GitHub expect this to work in the first place? New idea. What if I set my
author email correctly from the get-go and create an entirely new signed
commit?

```bash
git config --global user.email reilly@tuckersiemens.com
touch why-doesn\'t-this-work.txt
git add why-doesn\'t-this-work.txt
git commit -Sm "Why doesn't this work?"
git push --force origin master
```

<figcaption>
Oh, but it <em>does</em> work! <a href='oh-but-it-does.png'>View full size.</a>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Now I think I'm crazy. This works, but _why_? Something **must** be different,
but what is it? Let's check the `git log` again.

```
commit 8f08abcef9f4126ca617b0247c52264a619b049c
Author: Reilly Tucker Siemens <reilly@tuckersiemens.com>

    Why doesn't this work?
```

How does that look any different from the commit messages above that _didn't_
work? It doesn't _appear_ to be any different, so let's take a deeper look.
Borrowing from something I learned while reading the excellent [Git Immersion]
tutorial I made use of `git cat-file` to inspect the commit objects. Running
`git cat-file -p 87051d6` shows the commit object for a commit that GitHub
won't verify.

Why doesn't this work?
```

**Whoa.** While this may have already been obvious to some of you I had no idea
that git objects had separate authors and committers. GitHub was right all
along. The email in my signature _doesn't_ match the committer email. I'll bet
I can leverage `git filter-branch` again to finally fix this.

## How to Actually Actually Fix It (A.K.A Tell Git Who's Boss)

Just as there is a `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` environment variable to use in a filter,
there is also a `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`. Now I can simply

```bash
git filter-branch -f --env-filter "GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='reilly@tuckersiemens.com'; GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL='reilly@tuckersiemens.com'" --msg-filter 'sed "/iQIcBA.*/,/.*END PGP SIGNATURE.*/d"' --commit-filter 'git commit-tree -S "$@"' HEAD
```

and _voila!_, `git cat-file -p fd23e7c` shows a commit object with the correct
author **and** commiter.

Unfortunately, now the graph of my `git log` looks weird. I have double the
commits!

## Success

For the third time [Stack Overflow saves my bacon] and
```bash
git update-ref -d refs/original/refs/heads/master
```

cleans up my graph. Now I can force push to `origin master` _again_ and
everything will be right again.
