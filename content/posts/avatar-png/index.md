`TODO: Is this even a good title?`

`TODO: Don't forget to add a summary. Should probably just be a portion of the
intro paragraph.`

<!-- more -->

`TODO: Place image immediately after the summary.`

<!-- TODO: Fix width and height. <img src="avatar.png" height="256" width="256" alt="TODO"> -->

These files are web applications that generate PNGs on request containing a
friendly greeting with the IP address of the requester.

The PHP was originally written by Andrew Kvalheim probably around 2010. Its
filename at that time was avatar.png, so as to give the illusion that it was a
static file.

Used for Skype (I think? what else?) chat between university employees. Would
accept a URL for a profile picture. Image was fetched by the client. It might
have been hosted on a student web service allowed to run PHP.

Taught me the valuable lesson that file extensions are a lie, the web can do
whatever the heck it wants, and `Content-Type` is king.

There was magic in discovering the computer could be bent to one's whim
dynamically like this.

Child-like wonderment.

# PHP

`TODO: Which version of PHP would have been used? Spring-Summer 2010? Probably
some version of Ubuntu and Apache with mod PHP. Is it possible to run a similar
server for local testing during this post?`

``TODO: Does this load `UbuntuMono-Regular.ttf` on each request? According to the
docs it sure looks like it. How big is that file? What's the perf cost to load
it? Can I verify with `strace` or `dtrace` or some such? Or just do a quick
walkthrough of the PHP source code?``

```php
<?php

    //Get IP address
    $ip = explode('.' $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], 4);

    //Render image
    $image = @imagecreate(256, 256)
        or die("Cannot Initialize new GD image stream");
    $background_color = imagecolorallocate($image, 119, 41, 83);
    $text_color = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 255, 255);
    imagettftext($image, 24, 0, 8, 96, $text_color, 'UbuntuMono-Regular.ttf', "Hello, \n$ip[0].$ip[1].$ip[2].$ip[3]!");

    //Send response
    header('Content-Type: image/png');
    imagepng($image);
    imagedestroy($image);
?>
```

bit of lore in between.

``TODO: Might be worth noting that a lot of this comes from the first
`imagecreate` example. A good example of copying what you need and adapting it
to your purposes. As we become more experienced software engineers we often
think it needs to be just so, but there's real benefit from just grabbing what
you find and using it, especially for low-stakes fun.``

`TODO: How are all of these things magically in scope?`

# Rust

`Ok`. Let's set some ground rules.

1. I like it when blog posts build up solutions, showing mistakes and oddities
   on the way. If you want to skip all that, here's the
   [finished production code].

2. I'm assuming a basic level of Rust understanding. I don't expect you to have
   read [The Book] cover to cover, but I won't annotate each line in detail
   either.

3. As I translate this, keep in mind that PHP is a language made for the web.
   I'm not competing for brevity and certainly not trying to play [code golf].
   The Rust code **will** be longer.

4. I'll cut some corners in the initial implementation for the sake of
   understanding, but try to come back and make everything tidy by the end.

## Choosing A Framework

The original PHP was likely run in [Apache] using [mod_php], which appears to
be out of style these days. In Rust we often don't run a separate server like
Apache or [Nginx]. Instead the application and server are compiled into the
same binary and we choose between frameworks. I've been enjoying [Axum] lately,
so that's what I used, but I'm sure [Actix] or [Rocket] would have been fine
too.

First, we create a new Rust project and add our dependencies.

```bash
$ cargo new avatar && cd avatar
$ cargo add axum@0.6.20
$ cargo add tokio@1.34.0 --features=rt-multi-thread,macros
```

Then, we add Axum's ["Hello, World!"][hello_world] example to `src/main.rs` and
build up from there.

```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }));

    axum::Server::bind(&"0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

## Getting the IP

Going off the PHP example, the first thing to do is replicate the behavior of
`$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` and get the IP address of the client connecting to
the server. PHP [automagically] populates `$_SERVER` with this information, but
Axum wants us to be clear about our needs, so this gets a bit more complicated
right away.

```rust
use axum::{extract::ConnectInfo, routing::get, Router};
use std::net::SocketAddr;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route(
        "/",
        get(|ConnectInfo(addr): ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>| async move {
            format!("Hello, {}!", addr.ip())
        }),
    );

    axum::Server::bind(&"0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service_with_connect_info::<SocketAddr>())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

Axum also exposes connection information, but not quite as automagically. This
information is given to a [handler] (the [closure] we give to
[`get`][axum_routing_get]) via an [extractor]. If that all sounds very
abstract, it's because it is.

Specifically, we use the [`ConnectInfo<T>`][axum_extract_connectinfo] extractor
as an argument to our closure and destructure it to get a
[`SocketAddr`][socket_addr] (the desired `T`). These types can't be inferred,
so our handler arguments get a bit verbose. This extractor also requires we
create our app using
[`into_make_service_with_connect_info<C>`][into_make_service_with_connect_info]
, which is a long way of saying "let my app get connection info". That behavior
is not enabled by default.

Astute readers will have noticed that we also added the [`move`][move] keyword
to our [`async` block][async_block]. Without this our friendly compiler
steps in to give a lecture on [borrowing and ownership].

`TODO: Should this section get colored like the compiler output?`

```
error[E0373]: async block may outlive the current function, but it borrows `addr`, which is owned by the current function

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0373`.
```

What we've written expects the closure to capture `addr` by reference. However,
the compiler knows that Axum/Tokio will let the `async` block outlive the
closure itself, thus invalidating the reference. Thankfully, it warns us and
tells us what to do. So helpful! ðŸ˜Ž

`TODO: Double check the correctness of the above statement.`

The other way to get around this is to make our handler a function instead of a
closure.

```rust
async fn root(ConnectInfo(addr): ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}", addr.ip())
}
```

This also makes our app declaration prettier, so let's go with that.

```rust
let app = Router::new().route("/", get(root));
```

We can verify this works as intended with `curl`.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:3000/
Hello, 127.0.0.1!
```

## Making a PNG

Unfortunately, the assignment wasn't to return the client's IP address in
plaintext. For parity with the PHP we need to serve an image. Fortunately, the
[image] crate exists.

```bash
$ cargo add image@0.24.7
```

### Our Canvas

The image crate allows us to create a PNG in a fashion very similar to the PHP.
The analog of `@imagecreate` is to create an [`ImageBuffer`][image_buffer].
Instead of `imagecolorallocate`, the `ImageBuffer` struct has a convenient
[`from_pixel`][image_buffer_from_pixel] method which allows us to specify a
starting pixel that is then copied across our new canvas. We can start with a
single [`Rgb`][image_rgb] pixel.

```rust
use image::{ImageBuffer, Rgb, RgbImage};

const WIDTH: u32 = 256;
const HEIGHT: u32 = WIDTH;
// TODO: Swap these out for blog colors.
const BACKGROUND_COLOR: Rgb<u8> = Rgb([119, 33, 111]);

// ...

let img: RgbImage = ImageBuffer::from_pixel(WIDTH, HEIGHT, BACKGROUND_COLOR);
```

`TODO: Note the admirable use of generics in these types.`

### Adding Text

``TODO: How does this work with fonts? Can we at least not load the `.ttf` font each
time?``

``TODO: Talk about `Scale`, font size, pixels, and [point].``

`TODO: Talk about newlines?`

`TODO: What is the licensing for the font? Can I even use it? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-font-licence https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ufl-contributors/ubuntu-font-licence/trunk/view/head:/ubuntu-font-licence-1.0.txt`

## How Can We Make It Better?

### Error Handling

### IPv6 Support

### SVG

- Turns out SVG is hard and possibly not much better?
- Newline support is not much more clear. `tspan` vs. `textArea` (not supported)

### Benchmarking?

### HTTP 2?
