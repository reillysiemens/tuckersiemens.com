Several years ago I did a take-home interview which asked me to write a [TFTP]
server in [Go]. I decided the job wasn't the right fit for me at the time, but
the assignment and the protocol have stuck with me. Lately, in my spare time,
I've been tinkering with a [Rust] implementation.

## Caveat Lector

It's natural to write a technical blog post like this in a somewhat
authoritative tone. However, I am not an authority. There will be mistakes.
Techniques, libraries, and even protocols change over time. Keep in mind that I
am learning too and will happily accept corrections and critiques.

## Why Rust?

Much has been written on the merits of Rust by more qualified people. I
encourage you to seek their writing and make your own decisions. For my part, I
try my best to write fast, safe, and correct code. Rust lets me be more
confident about my solutions without the baggage (and danger) of the last 40
years of C/C++. Recent [statements][memory-safe-android] and
[events][rust-linux-kernel] would seem to agree.

If you know me, you might be surprised that this is my first post on Rust since
I've been hyping up the language for the last 7 years. Better late than never.

## What Is TFTP?

TFTP is the [Trivial File Transfer Protocol][TFTP], a simple means of reading
and writing files over a network. Initially defined in the early 80s, the
protocol was updated by [RFC 1350] in 1992. In this post I'll only cover RFC
1350. Extensions like [RFC 2347], which adds a 6th packet type, won't be
covered.

### A Note On Security

TFTP is _not_ a secure protocol. It offers no access controls, no
authentication, no encryption, nothing. If you're running a TFTP server assume
that any other host on the network can read the files hosted by it. You should
not run a TFTP server on the open Internet.

### Why Use TFTP?

At this point you might wonder why you would want to use TFTP if it's old,
insecure, and protocols like [HTTP] &amp; [SSH] exist. Fair enough. If you have other options,
you probably don't need to use it.

That said, TFTP is still widely used, especially in server and lab environments
where there are closed networks. Combined with [DHCP] and [PXE] it provides an
efficient means of [network booting] due to its small memory footprint. This is
especially important for embedded devices where memory is scarce. Additionally,
if your server supports the experimental [multicast] option with [RFC 2090],
files can be read by multiple clients concurrently.

## Protocol Overview

Now that we have a shared understanding of what TFTP is and when to use it,
let's dive a little deeper into how it works.

TFTP is implemented atop [UDP], which means it can't benefit from the
retransmission and reliability inherent in [TCP]. Clients and servers must
maintain their own connections. For this reason operations are carried out in
lock-step, requiring acknowledgement at each point, so that nothing is lost or
misunderstood.

### Reading

To read a file, a client client sends a read request packet. If the request is
valid, the server responds with the first block of data (512 bytes by default).
The client sends an acknowledgement of this block and the server responds with
the next block of data. The two continue this dance until there's nothing more
to read.

### Writing

Writing a file to a server is the inverse of reading. The client sends a write
request packet and the server responds with an acknowledgement. Then the client
sends the first block of data and the server responds with another
acknowledgement. Rinse and repeat until the full file is transferred.

## Packet Types

RFC 1350 defines five packet types, given in the table below. I'll elaborate on
each of them in turn.

| Opcode | Operation       | Abbreviation |
|--------|:----------------|--------------|
| 1      | Read Request    | `RRQ`        |
| 2      | Write Request   | `WRQ`        |
| 3      | Data            | `DATA`       |
| 4      | Acknowledgement | `ACK`        |
| 5      | Error           | `ERROR`      |

### `RRQ` / `WRQ`

Read and write requests share a representation, differing only by opcode. They
contain a filename and a mode as [null-terminated strings].

| 2 bytes | string   | 1 byte | string | 1 byte |
|:--------|:---------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| opcode  | filename | 0      | mode   | 0      |

Here's an example of the raw bytes in an `RRQ` for a file called `foobar.txt`
in `octet` mode.

<pre class="language-rust" data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#282828;color:#fdf4c1aa;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">let</span><span> rrq </span><span style="color:#fe8019;">= </span><span style="color:#b8bb26;">b"<span style="color:#fa5c4b;">\x00\x01</span>foobar.txt<span style="color:#fa5c4b;">\x00</span>octet<span style="color:#fa5c4b;">\x00</span>"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>

### `DATA`

Data packets contain the block number being sent and the corresponding data as
raw bytes.

| 2 bytes | 2 bytes     | n bytes   |
|:--------|:------------|:----------|
| opcode  | block &num; | data      |

Here's an example of the raw bytes in a `DATA` packet for the first block of a
transfer with the contents `Hello, World!`.

<pre class="language-rust" data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#282828;color:#fdf4c1aa;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">let</span><span> data </span><span style="color:#fe8019;">= </span><span style="color:#b8bb26;">b"<span style="color:#fa5c4b;">\x00\x03\x00\x01</span>Hello, World!"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>

### `ACK`

Acknowledgements need only contain the block number they correspond to.

| 2 bytes | 2 bytes     |
|:--------|:------------|
| opcode  | block &num; |

Here's an example of the raw bytes in an `ACK` packet for the first block of a
transfer.

<pre class="language-rust" data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#282828;color:#fdf4c1aa;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">let</span><span> ack </span><span style="color:#fe8019;">= </span><span style="color:#b8bb26;">b"<span style="color:#fa5c4b;">\x00\x04\x00\x01</span>"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>

### `ERROR`

Errors contain a numeric error code and a human-readable, null-terminated
string error message.

| 2 bytes | 2 bytes    | string        | 1 byte |
|:--------|:-----------|:--------------|:-------|
| opcode  | error code | error message | 0      |

Here's an example of the raw bytes in an `ERROR` packet for a "File not found"
error.

<pre class="language-rust" data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#282828;color:#fdf4c1aa;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">let</span><span> error </span><span style="color:#fe8019;">= </span><span style="color:#b8bb26;">b"<span style="color:#fa5c4b;">\x00\x05\x00\x01</span>File not found<span style="color:#fa5c4b;">\x00</span>"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>

By default, TFTP defines eight error codes. Since the error code is a 16-bit
integer there's enough space for you and your friends to define 65,528 of your
own. In practice, maybe don't.

| Value    | Meaning                                  |
|----------|:-----------------------------------------|
| 0        | Not defined, see error message (if any). |
| 1        | File not found.                          |
| 2        | Access violation.                        |
| 3        | Disk full or allocation exceeded.        |
| 4        | Illegal TFTP operation.                  |
| 5        | Unknown transfer ID.                     |
| 6        | File already exists.                     |
| 7        | No such user.                            |
| &hellip; | &hellip;                                 |
| 65,535   | Go wild, do whatever.                    |


## Type Design

Now we all know entirely too much about TFTP. Let's write some code already!

Before I start parsing anything I find it helpful to design the resulting
types. That informs both how I expect to use the types in my application code
and my parsing machinery.

Let's motivate this design by looking at the code that would use it.

- Showcase `tokio` UDP socket send/recv code.
- Talk about `Request` vs. `Transfer` split.
