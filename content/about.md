# About Me

<img src='/self.jpg' height='256' width='256' alt='Reilly Tucker Siemens'>

Hey, there! I'm Tucker.

I'm employed as a software engineer in Seattle. I love photography, rock
climbing, great brews (coffee _and_ beer), whiskey I can't afford, and a wide
variety of music. There's a special place in my heart for jazz, which my father
taught me to love. üé∑‚ù§Ô∏è

I spend my free time working on my [projects](/projects) and I occasionally
write [posts](/) about my experiences. In particular, I enjoy learning about
programming languages (compilers, type systems, etc.), web development, and how
to write robust, secure code.
