You can find me on GitHub as [@reillysiemens] and on Twitter as
[@TuckerSiemens]. If you want to email me, you can use my first name at this
domain dot com. You can use [my key] if you're willing to suffer the `gpg`
interface.

I'm not currently looking for employment opportunities and I _especially_ don't
wish to be contacted about blockchains, cryptocurrencies, or NFTs.
