Hey, there! I'm Tucker. My pronouns are [he/him].

I'm a software engineer from Seattle. I enjoy hiking, yoga &amp; meditation,
making cocktails, drinking coffee, and listening to a wide variety of
music. <!-- Also, long walks on the beach. --> There's a special place in my
heart for jazz, which my dad taught me to love.

I spend my free time working on [hobby projects] and I occasionally write
[posts] about my experiences. In particular, I enjoy learning about programming
languages (compilers, type systems, etc.), web development, and how to write
fast programs that don't compromise on robustness or security.
