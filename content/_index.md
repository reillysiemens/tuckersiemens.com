<h1>Reilly Tucker Siemens</h1>

Hey, there! I'm Tucker. My pronouns are [he/him].

I'm a software engineer from Seattle. I love photography, yoga &amp;
meditation, making cocktails, drinking great brews (coffee _and_ beer), and
listening to a wide variety of music. There's a special place in my heart for
jazz, which my dad taught me to love.

I spend my free time working on [hobby projects] and I occasionally write
[posts] about my experiences. In particular, I enjoy learning about programming
languages (compilers, type systems, etc.), web development, and how to write
fast programs without compromising on robustness and security.
