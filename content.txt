DO NOT FORGET RSS FEED!!!

Technical:
----------
open graph (og:image?)
:where() selector in vanilla CSS
var() and :root
<time> tag
whitespace bug in anchor link
font-variant-caps vs. c2sc and smcp

trying, but ultimately not using  `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {}`
didn't mesh with personal style, but is still a good idea for service pages

if i were smarter, i would have built "mobile first", starting with the
smallest viewport and building up from there. doing it backwards is very
painful.
